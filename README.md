# Elementary_Algorithims_in_Go
This repository contains some elementary algorithms in go that seek to solve basic and complex problems using the Go language.

## Sources
Some of the problems are obtained from some coding websites such as [codewars](https://www.codewars.com) and some are just personal problems that I've found from my various research and learning.

# Dependancies
Some of the programs will be using custom Go libraries that are outside the scope of the Go in-built packages.
The major one is the [z01](https://www.github.com/01-edu/z01).

How to install:

    $ go get github.com/01-edu/z01
